# Self-hosting

Fief is a platform that you host for free on your own infrastructure.

In [Getting started](../getting-started/local-instance.md), we show you a way to easily start your instance locally. However, for production usage, we highly recommend you to perform a complete setup. We provide guides and blueprints to get you started on various **hosting technologies** and **cloud platforms**.

[Render](./deployment/render.md){ .md-button }
[Docker Compose](./deployment/docker-compose.md){ .md-button }

[^1]: Railway rewards us 25% of your spending in the form of platform credits, as part of their [Template Kickback](https://railway.app/open-source-kickback) program. It doesn't directly finance us, but it helps us to pay some bills, like our GitHub bot.
