You'll be prompted to configure two environment varialbles: [`FIEF_MAIN_USER_EMAIL`](../environment-variables.md#fief-ception) and [`FIEF_MAIN_USER_PASSWORD`](../environment-variables.md#fief-ception). Those are the credentials of the first admin user that'll be created on server startup.

After a few minutes, your Fief server will be up-and-running on the default Railway subdomain!

## Custom domain

By default, the project will be assigned a default Railway subdomain, like `server-production-4018.up.railway.app`.

To add your domain, follow the instructions on Railway documentation: [https://docs.railway.app/guides/public-networking#custom-domains](https://docs.railway.app/guides/public-networking#custom-domains)

## Cost estimation

Railway's pricing is based on memory, CPU and network usage. Thus, the pricing will **highly vary depending on your workload**.

We estimate that for a small or medium sized-instance, the cost should be **around 10 and 20 USD per month**.
